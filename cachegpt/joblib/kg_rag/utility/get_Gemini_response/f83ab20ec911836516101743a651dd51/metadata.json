Use any of them if needed: \\n                - Procenance & Symptoms information is useless \\n                - Similar diseases tend to have similar gene associations \\n                - Gene-disease associations are informative for disease similarity \\n                - Phenotypic similarity correlates with genetic similarity \\n                - Age-of-onset profiles can indicate genetic similarity \\n                - Functional annotations of genes provide additional context \\n                - Protein-protein interactions offer additional disease relationships \\n                - Comorbidity patterns can indicate shared mechanisms \\n                - Evolutionary profiles of disease-associated genes can be informative \\n                - Expression and methylation changes with age can be relevant \\n                Question: Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with marginal zone lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
